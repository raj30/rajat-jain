Hi, I'm Rajat Jain. Salesforce Consultant from Jaipur, India. After graduating with Information technology as a major, I have worked in the Salesforce domain from the last 3.5 years with market-driven startups and traveled the journey from no one to someone.

I am currently working for the client that is one of the Government Agency of the United States delivering more than 20+ projects, so far I have implemented multiple complex modules covering the Sales, Service and Commerce cloud of the salesforce. And also I have been mentoring people from 2 years and have been growing in the community by providing sessions, blogs, and mentorship.

Thank you for reading...!!!
