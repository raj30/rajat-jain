Hi, I'm Rajat Jain. Salesforce Consultant and a proud #EinsteinChampion from Jaipur, India. After graduating with Information technology as a major, I have been working in the Salesforce world from the last 3.5 years with market-driven startups and traveled the journey from no one to someone.

I am currently working for a large business client and have delivered more than 20 projects for them. I have implemented multiple complex modules covering the Sales, Service and Commerce cloud of the Salesforce and recently started exploring Einstein modules. Mentoring folks and working with the community is one of my passion that keeps me motivated and pumped up with energy, all the time.

Thank you for reading...!!!
