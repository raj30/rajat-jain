**What's Einstein Search?**

One of the best tools I’ve seen for implementing search functionality is Einstein Search. It personalizes your search expertise and serves up recommendations on the records that it thinks are most vital to you. It uses machine learning to refine the recommendations over time supporting what you’re looking out and viewing.

* Actionable

1. **Personal**

   Sales people and service agents place confidence in Salesforce as their single source of truth for client data. This is why Einstein Search makes sure that the flexibility to return personalized results for each user.

   For example, if a sales representative is from California city and whenever representative searches for any Account user get the personalized result in a form where all the accounts having billing city as California and then records related to other cities. It personalizes the results on the basis of geography, industry, SIC, account source, type, users, etc.

   Enterprise users expect seamless search expertise once they use their applications. Einstein Search understands language, specifically because it applies to Salesforce. for instance, if a sales rep sorts in “my open opportunities in California city,”

   Einstein Search interprets that question as sort of a human would. Einstein generates a SOSL query according to the input of the user and returns the query results. IT supports the most common filter concepts like status, location, and ownership.
